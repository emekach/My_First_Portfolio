  <p>
    This is my very first webpage created as part of my ALX learning journey. 
    I am exploring the basics of HTML, the fundamental language of the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It provides the structure 
    and meaning to content on the web by using a variety of elements and tags.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this project, I am learning how to add headings, paragraphs, 
    images, and hyperlinks. This is a step toward becoming proficient in 
    web development.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I continue my studies, I will build more advanced web pages 
    by combining HTML with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
